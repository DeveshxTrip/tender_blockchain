# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```bash
npx hardhat help
```
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
```bash
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
